                Tokyo, city and capital of Tokyo to (metropolis) and of Japan.<br>
                It is located at the head of Tokyo Bay on the Pacific coast of central Honshu.<br>
                It is the focus of the vast metropolitan area often called Greater Tokyo, the largest urban and industrial agglomeration in Japan.<br>
                The site of Tokyo has been inhabited since ancient times; the small fishing village of Edo existed there for centuries.<br>
                Edo’s development into a city did not occur until the Tokugawa period (1603–1867), when it became the capital of the Tokugawa shogunate.<br>
                During this period, however, the imperial family remained in Kyōto, the ancient imperial capital. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, which ended the shogunate, the capital was moved to Edo.<br>
                The city was renamed Tokyo, meaning “eastern capital.” Edo had been Japan’s largest city since the 17th century.<br>
                Tokyo’s population exceeded one million in the late 19th century, and as Japan’s political, economic, and cultural centre it became one of the world’s most populous cities in the 20th century.<br><br><br><br>
