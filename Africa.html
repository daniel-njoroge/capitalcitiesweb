                Nairobi, city, capital of Kenya. It is situated in the south-central part of the country, in the highlands at an elevation of about 5,500 feet (1,680 metres).<br>
                The city lies 300 miles (480 km) northwest of Mombasa, Kenya’s major port on the Indian Ocean.<br>
                The city originated in the late 1890s as a colonial railway settlement, taking its name from a water hole known to the Maasai people as Enkare Nairobi (“Cold Water”).<br>
                When the railhead arrived there in 1899, the British colonial capital of Ukamba province was transferred from Machakos (now Masaku) to the site, and in 1905 Nairobi became the capital of the British East Africa Protectorate.<br>
                From about 1900 onward, when a small Indian bazaar was established at Nairobi, the city was also a trading centre.<br><br><br><br>

                Cape Town, city and seaport, legislative capital of South Africa and capital of Western Cape province.<br>
                The city lies at the northern end of the Cape Peninsula some 30 miles (50 kilometres), at its southernmost boundary, north of the Cape of Good Hope.<br>
                Because it was the site of the first European settlement in South Africa, Cape Town is known as the country’s “mother city.”<br>
                Cape Town has a beautiful setting: parts of the city and its suburbs wind about the steep slopes of Table Mountain (3,563 feet [1,086 metres] high) and neighbouring peaks and rim the shores of Table Bay; other parts lie on the flats below the slopes or stretch southward across the flats to False Bay.<br>
                The city covers an area of 116 square miles (300 square kilometres). Pop. (2005 est.) urban agglom., 3,103,000.<br>
