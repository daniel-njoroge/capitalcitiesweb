                London, city, capital of the United Kingdom.<br>
                It is among the oldest of the world’s great cities—its history spanning nearly two millennia—and one of the most cosmopolitan.<br>
                By far Britain’s largest metropolis, it is also the country’s economic, transportation, and cultural centre. London is situated
                in southeastern England, lying astride the River Thames some 50 miles (80 km) upstream from its estuary on the North Sea.<br>
                In satellite photographs the metropolis can be seen to sit compactly in a Green Belt of open land, with its principal ring 
                highway (the M25 motorway) threaded around it at a radius of about 20 miles (30 km) from the city centre.<br>
                The growth of the built-up area was halted by strict town planning controls in the mid-1950s.<br>
                Its physical limits more or less correspond to the administrative and statistical boundaries separating the metropolitan  
                county of Greater London from the “home counties” of Kent, Surrey, and Berkshire (in clockwise order) to the south of the river and Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, and Essex to the north.<br>
                The historic counties of Kent, Hertfordshire, and Essex extend in area beyond the current administrative counties with the same names to include 
                substantial parts of the metropolitan county of Greater London, which was formed in 1965.<br>
                Most of Greater London south of the Thames belongs to the historic county of Surrey, while most of Greater London north of the Thames belongs historically to the county of Middlesex.<br>
                Area Greater London, 607 square miles (1,572 square km). Pop. (2001) Greater London, 7,172,091; (2011 prelim.) Greater London, 8,173,941.<br.<br><br><br>

                Paris, city and capital of France, situated in the north-central part of the country.<br>
                People were living on the site of the present-day city, located along the Seine River some 233 miles (375 km) upstream from the river’s mouth on the English Channel (La Manche), by about 7600 BCE.<br>
                The modern city has spread from the island (the Île de la Cité) and far beyond both banks of the Seine.<br>
                Paris occupies a central position in the rich agricultural region known as the Paris Basin, and it constitutes one of eight départements of the Île-de-France administrative region.<br>
                It is by far the country’s most important centre of commerce and culture. Area city, 41 square miles (105 square km); metropolitan area, 890 square miles (2,300 square km).<br>
                Pop. (2020 est.) city, 2,145,906; (2020 est.) urban agglomeration, 10,858,874.<br><br><br><br>
